/*
 To create a new shape, 
 
 Method 1:
 1. Add an empty game object, (right click -> "Create Empty")
 2. Drag the script -> "Scripts/Shape.cs" onto the empty GameObject
 3. Choose the Shape Type option
 4. Determine the Operation (if any) you wish to apply to the shape.
 5. Choose the color if you wish
 6. Choose the amount that you wish it to 
    blend with other objects if your selected operation is Blend
    7. If you wish an operation to only apply to one object,
        (especially applies to the Mask operation)
        then you can add an object as a child-object by dragging it onto the parent
 
 Method 2:
 1. Copy "Default Shape Object" and alter options accordingly.
